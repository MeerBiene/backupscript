# Backupscript

A handly little script that generates a backupscript for you.

Intended usage: have the script running on your Raspberry Pi and place the "remoteruntime.sh" file in the root folder of the server you want to backup.

SSH Keys required! (If you dont know what this is theres plenty of tutorialsonline)

### (!) Not sure if I should recommend to use this anymore.. idk might rework this in python or as node app we'll see
