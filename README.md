# Backupscript

A handly little script that generates a backupscript for you.

Intended usage: have the script running on your Raspberry Pi and place the "remoteruntime.sh" file in the root folder of the server you want to backup.

SSH Keys required! (If you dont know what this is theres plenty of tutorialsonline)

### (!) These were my first steps with anything related to code so this script is utter bullshit but I like to remind myself where I'm coming from
